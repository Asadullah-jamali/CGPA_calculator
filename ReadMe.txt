# CGPA and GPA Calculator

## Overview
- This C++ program calculates the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) and Grade Point Average (GPA) based on user inputs for multiple semesters.
- It supports both fixed and variable subject counts and credit hours for each semester.

## Features
- Allows input for:
  - Number of semesters.
  - Number of subjects per semester (same or different).
  - Credit hours per subject (same or different).
  - Marks obtained in each subject.
- Calculates:
  - Total subjects.
  - Total credit hours.
  - Total marks.
  - GPA for each semester.
  - CGPA across all semesters.
  
## Grading Scale
- Marks and corresponding grade points:
  - â‰¥ 85: A (4.0)
  - 80 to < 85: A- (3.7)
  - 75 to < 80: B+ (3.3)
  - 70 to < 75: B (3.0)
  - 65 to < 70: B- (2.7)
  - 60 to < 65: C+ (2.3)
  - 55 to < 60: C (2.0)
  - 50 to < 55: C- (1.0)
  - < 50: F (0.0)

## Usage
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to input:
   - Number of semesters.
   - Whether the number of subjects is the same for all semesters.
   - Credit hours per subject.
   - Marks obtained for each subject.
4. View results, including GPA and CGPA.

## Example Input
- Number of semesters: `2`
- Subjects in semester 1: `3`
- Subjects in semester 2: `2`
- Credit hours: `3`
- Marks for each subject (input accordingly).

## Output
- Displays:
  - Marks obtained per subject.
  - Credit hours per subject.
  - GPA for each semester.
  - Total CGPA.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic understanding of console input/output in C++.
